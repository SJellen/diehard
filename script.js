 ` You don't like flying, do you? \n
  What gives you that idea?`,

 ` You want to know the secret to surviving air travel? After you get where you're going, take off your shoes and socks. Then you walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes. \n
  Fists with your toes? \n
  I know. It sounds crazy. Trust me.`,

 ` What do we do now? \n
 I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.\n 
 It's my first time driving a limo. \n
 That's OK. It's my first time riding in one.`,

 ` You always ask this many questions, Argyle? \n
 Sorry. I used to drive a cab and people would expect a little chitchat.`,

 ` I'll wait in the parking garage. You score, give me a call on the car phone. I'll take your bags to the desk. You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.\n
  You're all right, Argyle.\n
  Remember that when you sign for the tip.`,

  `You throw quite a party. I didn't realise they celebrated Christmas in Japan.\n 
  We're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't work out, so we got you with tape decks.`,

  `I missed you.\n
  Didn't miss my name, though, huh? Except maybe when you're signing checks?`,

  `Son of a bitch. Ha ha! Fists with your toes.`,

  `You know the number. Use it.`,

  `Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of greed around the globe... ..they're about to be taught a lesson in the real use of power. You will be witnesses.`,

  `Nice suit. John Phillips, London. I have two myself. Rumour has it Arafat buys his there.`,

  `"And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer." The benefits of a classical education`,

  `Mr Takagi I could talk about industrialisation and men's fashions all day but I'm afraid work must intrude and my associate here has some questions for you. Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions, actually.`,

  `You want money? What kind of terrorists are you? \n
   Who said we were terrorists?`,

  `It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi. It would be a shame to ruin it. I'm going to count to three. There will not be a four. Give me the code.`,

  `You're just gonna have to kill me.\n
  OK. We do it the hard way.`,

  `Now... you can break the code?\n
  You didn't bring me for my charming personality.`,

  `Argyle, tell me you heard the shots. You're calling the police right now.`,

  `Why the fuck didn't you stop him, John? Cause then you'd be dead, too, asshole. Think, goddamn it! Think!`,

  `You won't hurt me.\n
  Yeah? Why not?
  Because you're a policeman. There are rules for policemen.\n
  Yeah, that's what my captain keeps telling me.`,

  `Nine million terrorists in the world and I got to kill one with feet smaller than my sister.`,

  `I wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative. Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi did not see it that way… so he won’t be joining us for the rest of his life.`,

  `"Now I have a machine gun." "Ho... ho... ho."`,

  `This channel is reserved for emergency calls only.\n
   No fucking shit, lady! Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?,`,

   `If this is an emergency call, dial 911 on your telephone. Otherwise, I'll report this as an FCC violation.\n
   Fine! Report me! Come the fuck down here and arrest me! Just send the police now!`,

   `Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.\n
   They're for my wife.\n
   Yeah.\n
   She's pregnant.\n
   Yeah.`,

   `"Come out to the coast! We'll get together, have a few laughs."`,

   `Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.`,

   `Who's driving this car, Stevie Wonder?`,

   `You are done! No more table! Where are you going, pal? Next time you have a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate.\n
   Thanks for the advice.`,

   `Welcome to the party, pal!`,

   `You are most troublesome for a security guard.\n
   Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess. Would you like to go for double jeopardy where the scores can really change?`,

   `Who are you, then?\n
   Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench,...the pain in the ass.`,

   `Mr Mystery Guest, are you still there?\n
   Yeah, I'm still here unless you want to open the front door for me.\n
   No, I'm afraid not`,

   `You know my name, but who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child?`,

   `Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne, Rambo, Marshal Dillon?\n
   I was always partial to Roy Rogers, actually. I liked those sequined shirts.`,

   `Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?\n
   Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.`,

   `What does he think he's doing?\n
   His job.\n
   Bullshit. His job's 3,000 miles away.`,

   `..if the person who radioed for help can hear me, acknowledge this transmission!\n
   I read you, pal.\n
   You the guy in the car?\n
   What's left of him.`,

   `Listen fast. This is a party line. The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.`,

   `They're well-financed and very slick.\n
   How do you know that?\n
   I've seen enough phoney IDs in my time to recognise the ones they got must have cost a fortune.`,

   `..so light 'em if you got 'em.\n
   Way ahead of you, partner.\n
   So what do I call you?\n
   Call me Roy.`,

   `Powell, has it occurred to you he could be one of the terrorists pulling your chain or some nutcase in there?`,

   `I think he's a cop, maybe not LAPD, But he's definitely a badge.\n
   How do you know that?\n
   A hunch things he said like being able to spot a phoney ID.\n
   Jesus Christ, Powell! He could be a fucking bartender for all we know!`,

   `I have a request.\n
   What idiot put you in charge?\n
   You did when you murdered my boss.`,

   `All we know is that somebody shot your car up. It's probably the same silly son of a bitch you've been talking to on that radio.\n
   Excuse me, sir, but what about the body that fell out the window?\n
   Probably some stockbroker got depressed.`,

   `I'll talk to you later. If you are what I think you are, you'll know when to listen, when to shut up, and when to pray.`,

   `Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, except the four assholes coming in the rear in standard two-by-two cover formation.`,

   `Oh, my God! The quarterback is toast!\n
   Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.\n
   Hit it again.\n
   All right, you motherfucker, you made your point! Let them pull back!\n
   Thank you, Mr Cowboy. I'll take it under advisement. Hit it again.`,

   `Oh, shit!\n
   They're using artillery on us!\n
   You idiot, it's not the police. It's him.\n
   Holy shit.`,

   `This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T Robinson and I am in charge of this situation.\n
   Oh, you're in charge? I got some bad news for you, Dwayne. From up here it doesn't look like you're in charge of shit.`,

   `Hey, Roy, how you feeling?\n
   Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.\n
   Hey, look. I love you. So do a lot of the other guys. So hang in there, man, you hear me? You hang in there.\n
   Yeah, thanks, partner.`,

   `I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first, them or your husband.\n
   What are you going to do?\n
   Hey, babe, I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast. I think I can handle this Eurotrash.`,

   `It's not what I want. It's what I can give you. Look, let's be straight, OK? It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here to snatch a few purses.\n
   You're very perceptive.`,

   `I watch "60 Minutes". I say to myself, these guys are professional, they're motivated, they're happening, they want something. I couldn't care less about your politics.`,

   `It's none of my business. I figure you're here to negotiate, am I right?\n
   You're amazing. You figured this all out already?\n
   Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen. What's the difference?`,

   `Let's put it in my terms. You're here on a hostile takeover. You grab us for some green but you didn't expect some poison pill was gonna be running around the building. Am I right?`,

   `Hans, bubbie... I'm your white knight.\n
   I must have missed "60 Minutes". What are you saying?\n
   The guy upstairs who's fucking things up, huh? I can give him to you.`,

   `Oh, God...\n
   Roy? Roy, you all right?\n
   Just trying to fire down a 1,000-year-old Twinkie. What do they put in these things, anyway?\n
   Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60, and yellow dye number five. Just everything a growing boy needs.`,

   `Touching, cowboy. Touching. Or should I call you Mr McClane? Mr Officer John McClane of the New York Police Department?\n
   Sister Theresa called me Mr McClane in the third grade. My friends call me John and you're neither, shithead.`,

   `Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth! Put Hans back on the line. Hans, this shithead doesn't know what kind of man you are but I do.\n
   Good. Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life.`,

   `Hey, what am I, a method actor? Babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television.`,

   `Do you hear that? Talk to me! Where are my detonators? Where are they, or shall I shoot another one? Sooner or later I might get to someone you do care about.\n
   Go fuck yourself, Hans.`,

   `He just let the guy die. He just gave him up. Give me that headset. That's like pulling the trigger yourself.\n
   Can't you see what's happening? Can't you read between the lines? He did everything he could to save him. If he gave himself up, they'd both be dead right now!\n
   No way, man. They'd be talking to us.`,

   `You tell this partner of yours to stay out of this from now on. Because if he doesn't, I'm really going to nail his ass.`,

   `The man is hurting. He is alone, tired, and he hasn't seen diddly-squat from anybody here! You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn about what you do to him if he makes it out of there alive? Why don't you wake up and smell what you're shoveling?`,

   `This is Hans Gruber. I assume you realise the futility of direct action against me. We have no wish for further loss of life. \n
   What is it you do wish for?\n
   I have comrades in arms around the world languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends. Now it can rattle it for me.`,

   `In Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian Dawn.\n
   What the fuck? Asian Dawn?\n
   I read about them in "Time magazine".`,

   `Hey, Powell, you out there?\n
   I'm here, John. I'm here.\n
   You gotta believe me. There was nothing I could do.\n
   Well, it's gonna be both our asses if you're wrong.\n
   I hear you.`,
   
   `Did you catch that bullshit Hans was running? It doesn't make sense, man.\n
   Hey, don't ask me, man. I'm just a deskjockey who was on my way home when you rang.\n
   The way you drove that car I figured you for the street, Al.`,

   `Well, Gail, by this time, the hostages should be going through the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.\n
   As in Helsinki, Sweden.\n
   Finland.`,

   `Sir, the FBI is here.\n
   The FBI is here now?\n
   Yes, sir. Right over there.\n
   Hold this.\n
   Want a breath mint?`,

   `I'm Agent Johnson. This is Special Agent Johnson.\n
   Oh, how you doing?\n
   No relation.\n
   I'm, uh... I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I'm in charge here.\n
   Not any more.`,

   `You don't work for Nakatomi. And if you're not one of them...\n
   I'm a cop from New York.\n
   New York?\n
   Yeah. Got invited to the Christmas party by mistake.\n
   Who knew?\n
   Better than being caught with your pants down, huh?`,

   `All you got to do is pull the trigger. Come on.\n
   Put down the gun and give me my detonators.\n
   Well, well, well...Hans.\n
   Put it down now.\n
   That's pretty tricky with that accent. You oughta be on fucking TV with that accent.`,

   `I'm going to count to three.\n
   Yeah. Like you did with Takagi? Oops. No bullets. What do you think... I'm fucking stupid, Hans?`,

   `God, that man looks really pissed.\n
   He's still alive.\n
   What?\n
   Only John can drive somebody that crazy.`,

   `John McClane, you still with us? \n
   Yeah. But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. Chalk up two more bad guys.\n
   The boys down here will be glad to hear that. We got a pool going on you.\n
   What kind of odds am I getting?\n
   You don't want to know.\n
   Put me down for 20.\n
   I'm good for it.`,

   `Hey, pal, you got flatfeet?\n
   What the hell are you talking about, man?\n
   Something had to get you off the street. What's the matter?\n
   You don't think jockeying papers across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?\n
   No.\n
   I had an accident.\n
   The way you drive, I can see why.`,

   `What'd you do ? Run over your captain's foot with the car?\n
   I shot a kid. He was 13 years old. Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him. He had a ray gun, looked real enough.`,

   `When you're a rookie, they teach you everything about being a cop except how to live with a mistake. Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself to draw my gun on anybody again.\n
   Sorry, man.\n
   Hey, man, how could you know?`,

   `I feel like shit anyway.\n
   Well, then, this won't matter.\n
   The LAPD is not calling the shots down here any more.\n
   The Feds?\n
   You got it.`,

   `That's the FBI. They're ordering the others to cut the building's power. Regular as clockwork.\n
   Or a time lock.\n
   Precisely.\n
   The circuits that cannot be cut are cut automatically in response to a terrorist incident. You asked for miracles, Theo. I give you the F-B-I.`,

   `Al, talk to me. What's going on here?\n
   Ask the FBI. They got the universal terrorist playbook and they're running it step by step.`,
   
   `Powell? Yo, Powell, you got a minute?\n
   I'm here, John.\n
   Listen, I'm starting to get a bad feeling up here.`,

   `I want you to tell her that... Tell her it took me a while to figure out what a jerk I've been that when things started to pan out for her I should have been more supportive. And, I just should have been behind her more.Tell her that, um that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. `,

   `She's heard me say "I love you" a thousand times. She never heard me say I'm sorry. I want you to tell her that, Al. Tell her that John said that he was sorry. OK? You got that man?
   Yeah, I got it, John. But you can tell her that yourself.`,

   `What were you doing, Hans? What were you doing? Jesus, Mary, mother of God. Al, listen to me! It's a double-cross! The roof is wired to...
   John?`,
   
   `John! John, come in! Did you get that?\n
   Something about a double-cross.\n
   Tell me about it.`,

   `They're coming!\n
   Choppers are coming.\n
   Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.`,

   `You should have heard your brother squeal when I broke his fucking neck!`,

   `I figure we take out the terrorists, lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.\n
   I can live with that.\n
   Get this thing on the deck. They're expecting transports, not gunships.`,

   `After all your posturing, all your little speeches, you're nothing but a common thief.\n
   I am an exceptional thief, Mrs McClane. And since I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.`,

   `Yee-hah! Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?\n
   I was in Junior High, dickhead.`,

   `I promise I will never even think about going up in a tall building again. Oh, God, please don't let me die! Holy Christ!`,

   `We're gonna need some more FBI guys, I guess.`,

   `So that's what this is all about? A fucking robbery?\n
   Put down the gun.\n
   Why'd you have to nuke the whole building, Hans?\n
   Well, when you steal $600, you can just disappear. When you steal 600 million, they will find you unless they think you're already dead.`,

   `Still the cowboy, Mr McClane. Americans... all alike. This time, John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.\n
   That was Gary Cooper, asshole.`,

   `You'd have made a pretty good cowboy yourself, Hans.\n
   Oh, yes. What was it you said to me before? Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.`,

   `Al, this is my wife Holly. Holly Gennero.\n
   Holly McClane.\n
   Hello, Holly. You got yourself a good man. You take good care of him.`,

   `Merry Christmas, Argyle.\n
   Merry Christmas.\n
   Did you get that?\n
   Let me through. If this is their idea of Christmas, I gotta be here for New Year's.`,
